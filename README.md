我是Ling，一个喜欢一切美好事物的彩笔科技宅，这是我提交的第一个项目。

macOS端的b站体验十分糟糕，很长一段时间里我都是使用bewlybewly，但是受限于网页本身的问题体验也有不太好的地方。前几天在ChatGPT的帮助下，我将项目源码重新进行了编译并打包，现在能够在macOS上正常运行了。非常简单的操作，几乎没有遇到什么难点，感谢ChatGPT。

由于是全套源码编译，所以pilipalaX原有的功能和bug都一起带来了，同时还有新增粗暴编译带来的不适配桌面端大屏的各种问题，比如ui间距，手势操作等，我并非CS相关专业，和交互设计相关的代码后续可能会尝试改改吧，功能相关的我无能为力，先解决一个从无到有的问题。_(:3」∠)_

如果您希望在移动端运行piilipalaX，请访问原项目地址获取：https://github.com/orz12/PiliPalaX

我对于GitHub并不熟悉，也不太清楚开源社区应该如何引用、注明或致谢原项目，需要访问此项目的各位指导我，任何意见和建议都可以在issues中发送，我会定期查看。谢谢各位的理解和支持！





I’m Ling, a tech enthusiast and designer who loves all things beautiful. This is the first project I’ve ever submitted.

The Bilibili experience on macOS has been quite poor. For a long time, I used bewlybewly, but due to limitations of the web itself, the experience still had several drawbacks. A few days ago, with the help of ChatGPT, I recompiled the project’s source code and packaged it into a macOS app. It now runs successfully on macOS. The process was very straightforward, and I didn’t encounter many difficulties — thanks to ChatGPT for that.

Since I compiled the full source code, all of piliPalaX’s existing features — as well as its bugs — are present in this version. Additionally, some issues have emerged due to the crude adaptation for larger desktop screens, such as UI spacing and gesture operations. I’m not a CS major — I’m a design student — but I may try to tweak some of the interaction-related code later. For now, I’m just happy to have gone from nothing to something.

I’m not very familiar with GitHub, nor do I fully understand the proper ways to reference, acknowledge, or credit open-source projects. If you’re visiting this page and have suggestions, feel free to leave them in the issues section — I’ll check regularly. Thank you all for your understanding and support!
